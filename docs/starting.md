# Getting Started

## Downloading .NET core

Head over to [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1) and download .NET for your platform. Run and
install .NET afterwards.

## Downloading 3Snipe
Head over to [the releases page](https://github.com/3SnipeOfficial/3Snipe/releases/tag/v2.0.0-future) and download the .zip
for your platform.

### Windows

Open the .zip file and extract all files.
Then, open the folder and run! Move on to `Usage`.

### Mac

Unzip `osx-x64.zip`. Open terminal. Run `cd path/to/3snipe`, replacing `path/to/3snipe` with the actual path.
Run `chmod +x 3Snipe` (do this after every update). Now run `./3Snipe`, and you will see 3Snipe! Move on to `Usage`.

### Linux

Open a terminal or shell. Run `cd path/to/3snipe-zip-file`. Run `unzip linux-arch.zip`, replacing `arch` with your processor's architecture. If you get an error, install `zip` and
`unzip` using your package manager, and then run it again. Run `chmod +x linux-arch/3Snipe`, again replacing `arch` with your processor's architecture. `cd` into `linux-arch` (do the replacement again) and run `./3Snipe`! Move on to `Usage`.
