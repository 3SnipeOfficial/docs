# Usage

Now that you've made it this far, let's snipe a name!

## Choose a path(!?)

You can either load accounts into a new file called `accounts.txt` and restart 3Snipe, or you can load them
using the frontend.

Start by opening the Snipe menu, and then selecting option 1.

### File method

Load `accounts.txt` with accounts, like this:
```
account@domain.com:passw0rd!
account@domain.com:passw0rd!   sec1:sec2:sec3
```
Do not repeat accounts. Security question accounts are `email:password` and 4 spaces followed by the answers.

### Manual Input

Copy-and-paste your accounts into 3Snipe. Press enter while it's blank to stop inputting.

## Delay!?

This removes x milliseconds before the droptime to snipe. Useful for beating other snipers.
Next two options you should leave alone (unless you know what to do).

## No output.

Done! Wait for the name to drop.
